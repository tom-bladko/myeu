    policies may be disabled, it cost TIME and STAB hit but advisors return to pool and can be reused

## DIPLOMACY & ESPIONAGE

    special agent DIPLOMAT is used to perform action

    and all espionage actions consume varied number of agents

        70% of nothing
        20% of success

## EXPLORATION

    you dont sent army / ships to discover map
    you select any province that is nearby terra incognita (it will be highlited by green)
    you can sent explorer depends on distance and chance (e.g. there is war ongoing nearby)
    after N turn explorer either will success or not, making one random province nearby visible
    you spend settlers agents to perform this action

    you can trade which provinces you explored as part of diplomacy

    it damage it, and if its already damage, then kill it
    hit is calculated as ratio between attacker attack and defender defense

    how miltary works in game ?
    in province there are some navies and land armies

        on province under flag there is a number that shows total number of units / ships
        there is no information to whom they belong to, or if this is navy or army
        if player click on province in side panel there would be all details

    how battles works ?
        if armies meet on battle field then special battle mode is used
        each country has a technology level for LAND and NAVAL units in range 0-12 (extended 0-15)
        naming convention
            ARMY
                has INF, CAV, ART as numbers
            FLEET
                has WAR, GAL, TRA as numbers
            CATEGORY
                INF, CAV, ART, WAR, GAL, TRA
            CLASS
                INF -> HI, LI, RI
                CAV -> HC, LC, RC
                ART -> HA, LA, SA
                etc
            TYPE
                Pikeman, Bowman, Arqebuzer, Knight, Samurai etc...
                Each type belongs to single CLASS
            UNIT
                Single unit of a specific TYPE 
        unit categories for naval fleets are divided:
            WAR 
                Light warship
                Heavy warship
            GAL
                Light galley
                Heavy galley    
            TRA
                transport
        Based on technology level in specific area (LAND / NAVAL) player gets max type of unit
        Based on player state policies player get ratio of specific categories
        so for level LAND 7 and mobile warfware policy 
            9 INF -> 30% RI + 30% HI + 40% LI -> 3 RI + 3 HI + 3 LI

grain + fish or meat -> food     

timber -> lumber -> paper   
                 -> chair



ore + coal  -> iron -> arms

goods

zaczac od czegos prostego

        
prowincja ma 
    level (który lekko przenosi sie na populacje np 17 -> 153K)
    growth który jest w % rocznie np 7% rocznie -> 7 na 7.07 w 12 tur
    level jest podstawa do wszystkich podatków etc...

# Population

### Core concepts

- Province has a level similar to games like Civilization or Eador.
- Population calculated from level is applied on province level, not a single city. 
- Usually it is up to 6 for good province at start, 9 in the middle and 12 in end game.
- Having 4 province with level 3 is more or less same for power calculation like 2 with power of 6 or 1 with power of 12
- All changes to population are done on level, the actual population is only for reporting. 

### Population growth

- Population level grows automatically in % per decade
- Very good growth is aprox 15-20% per decade which means 1 level up for 50-70 years
- Growth is not related to actual population, its not 20% from base, but it means +0.2 level for 10 years

### Base income from population

- Population level is used for growth only and display on the map
- Actual modifier of income from this province is taken as Bonus column from table below
- Province must grow to specific level to get bonus, nothing is calculated with float values
- Each province level is aprox 20-25% stronger than previous one

### Level of province

- Table can help to convert level of province to aprox population and what is income bonus (depends on model)

| LVL | Pop [k]   | Bonus | Bonus 2 | Bonus 3 |
|-----|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| 1   | 1     | 0.1   | 10%    | 100%  |
| 2   | 2     | 0.2   | 20%    | 110%  |
| 3   | 4     | 0.3   | 30%    | 120%  |
| 4   | 8     | 0.4   | 38%    | 130%  |
| 5   | 16    | 0.5   | 47%    | 150%  |

# FORTS

Province may have a building that improve defences level
Normally fort gives +5 to defences but other building may be different
Each level of province defence give local army + number of months for siege
   - N   army size / months with supplies
   - 1   1 / 3
   - 2   2 / 6
   - 3   3 / 9
   - 4   4 / 12
   - 5   5 / 15
   - 6   6 / 18

fort cost 
    200$ per level so level 5 cost 1000$
    takes 3 turns to build per level
    technology required is fort size * 2 so 2, 4, 6, 8, etc

# Exploration

Player collect explorer agent on country level
It could be used to explore region, area or continent
No units are used to unlock territories, it must be connected to your own explored area and just unlock it
each province based on location and size and terrain type / climate has cost to explore
Areas are cheap (based on province count and size), regions are x2 cost they should and continent are x3 cost they should

When sharing / stealing maps with other countries you never explore individual provinces, but areas, regions, continents

# Tactical warfare

## General info

Armies has 3 **types** of units:
- Infantry 
- Cavalry 
- Artillery 
- Leader (special unit that is created when strong leader is on army)
- Wall  (special unit that is created when defending province with FORT)

Scale is aprox 2-4k soldiers = 1 unit
Navies has 3 **types** of units: 
 - warship, 
 - small ship, 
 - transport
 - admiral

### Special unit Leader

Leader is unit that has very small fight skill BUT can support friendly units nearby:
 - Heal 
 - Improve morale (double move)
 - Panic enemy (lose move) 
 - has high sight range 
 - can cover nearby unit ?
 - can ghost one friendly unit ?

### Units on forts

Wall is special unit only during sieges. It works like a wall 4 tiles from right side.

Type of wall is based on your land tech level:
- Palisade
- Stone
- Stone 2 ?
- Concreate ?

For every level of fort in province you will get: 
- 1 artillery unit based on your tech level
- 2 infantry unit based on your tech level
- No cavalry neither leader 

Max number of fort is 5 so total 5 ART and 10 INF + Walls

## Morale

### How morale works during battle

Army has morale that is from range -5 to +5 with default 0

Each level means some chance for:
 - if > 0 then double move this turn
 - if < 0 lose move this turn

Panic due to damage:
- unit has 10 HP
- every HP below 5 has 10% to lose turn
- if unit that has failed morale test and has less then 5HP will flee 

### What impacts morale before battle ?

Country ruler military skill 
- skill 1-2     -1
- skill 3-4     0
- skill 5-6     +1

Country state religion
- peacefully    -1
- warmonger     +1

Military upkeep on country level
- low      -1 for 50%
- medium   0 for 100%
- high     +1 for 150%

country policies up to +-2

### How morale is changing during battle ?

- Unit got damage = lose 0.1
- Army lose unit = lose 0.2
- Army lose leader = lose 0.5
- Army kill enemy unit = gain 0.1
- Army kill enemy leader =  gain 0.2

Every turn your morale is moving to initial value by +- 0.2

### How morale is used to calculate moves

Each unit has 1 move per turn
Each morale above 0 is 10% chance to have additional move this turn
Each morale below 0 is 10% chance to have panic this turn and have no moves

### Unit type on battlefield is based on:
 - size of Army per category INF / CAV / ART
 - country technology level LAND / NAVAL, always pick the best unit
 - country tech group
 
### Tech groups:
- Western
- Eastern
- Ottoman
- Muslim
- Indian
- Nomad
- Chinese
- African
- New World (native americans, polynesia, meso america, andean )

### Unit Table

- Land technology level spans from 0 to 15 that gives aprox 6 ranks of units in each category.
- Different tech group may have strong / weak units in different epochs 

## Unit Types

Unit stats (defined on TYPE level)
- fire         damage when using range attack
- shock        damage when using melee attack
- defense      chance to deduct damage       
- range        range of attack (1 for melee)
- speed        move speed per turn
- hitpoints    in general all have 10
- ammo         number of attacks per battle

# Battle field

# FAQ

## What if country want to have both bowman and pikeman ?
- provide more names in unit_type_table and game will random unit from this list e.g. pikeman,pikeman,archer

## How technology is bought
- Like in imperialism. We do check each tech and if its available
- Techs do show up only AFTER year like in imperialism
- You can unlock them with Inventor points
